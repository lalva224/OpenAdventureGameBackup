IMAGERY = """
The world explodes into a cacophony of color and noise as you hurtle through the Chronos Gate. Images flash before your eyes - pyramids reaching for the sun, knights clashing in a steel ballet, sleek spaceships soaring through a starlit void. Then, just as abruptly, the chaos subsides.

You find yourself standing on a cobblestone street, the air thick with the stench of smoke and sewage. A crooked, half-timbered building looms over you, its windows dark and vacant. The year is clearly not your own. Ragged banners depicting a skeletal figure wielding a scythe flutter listlessly in the wind, casting long, ominous shadows across the deserted street.

A bone-chilling silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the distant cawing of crows. An unsettling emptiness pervades the scene - no bustling crowds, no vendors hawking their wares, just an eerie stillness that speaks of a town abandoned in fear.

Suddenly, a flicker of movement catches your eye. A lone figure emerges from a side alley, cloaked in a dark, hooded robe.  They move with a practiced caution, their face obscured by shadow.  A sense of dread creeps up your spine - is this a survivor, or something far more sinister?
